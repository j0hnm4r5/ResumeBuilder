# YAML Resume Generator

### How to use
1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), on a Mac: `brew install node`)
2. Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) globally: `npm install -g gulp-cli`
3. Install all the required packages: `cd` into the repo, then `npm install`
4. Create your own resume in YAML form named "resume.yaml" in the project root directory
5. Run `gulp dev` to begin live development, or `gulp build` to just create the HTML and PDF without all that fancy LiveReload stuff
